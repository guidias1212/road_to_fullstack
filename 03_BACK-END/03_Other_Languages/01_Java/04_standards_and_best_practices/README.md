# 3.3.1.4) Standards and Best Practices

Coding best practices are a set of informal rules that the software development community has learned over time which can help improve the quality of software.

Many computer programs remain in use for far longer than the original authors ever envisaged (sometimes 40 years or more), so any rules need to facilitate both initial development and subsequent maintenance and enhancement by people other than the original authors.
