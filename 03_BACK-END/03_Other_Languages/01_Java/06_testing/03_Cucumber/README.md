# 3.3.1.6.3) Cucumber

Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers that supports behavior-driven development (BDD). Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its plain language parser called Gherkin. It allows expected software behaviors to be specified in a logical language that customers can understand. As such, Cucumber allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text. It is often used for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.

Cucumber was originally written in the Ruby programming language. And was originally used exclusively for Ruby testing as a complement to the RSpec BDD framework. Cucumber now supports a variety of different programming languages through various implementations, including Java and JavaScript. The open source port of Cucumber in .Net is called SpecFlow. For example, Cuke4php and Cuke4Lua are software bridges that enable testing of PHP and Lua projects, respectively. Other implementations may simply leverage the Gherkin parser while implementing the rest of the testing framework in the target language.
