**Introduction:**

Consumer-Driven Contracts are a pattern for evolving services. In Consumer-Driven Contracts, each consumer captures their expectations of the provider in a separate contract. All of these contracts are shared with the provider so they gain insight into the obligations they must fulfill for each individual client.
