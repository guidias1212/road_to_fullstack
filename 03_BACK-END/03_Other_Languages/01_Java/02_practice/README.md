# 3.3.1.2) Practice

This is a script to automatically start all programs and setup my working environment (Repetitive tasks).

* Start Notepad ++;
* Open Google Chrome (With specific tab);
* Open GitHub for Desktop;
* Open Eclipse;
* Open FullStack directory;
* Start MySQL80 service (Start Database);
* Open MySQL Workbench;

**OBS.:** I've also created a Start.bat file with admin rights that compiles and run the java script. (To make it as easier as an double click!).

* Start.bat file:
```
cd path\to\StartEnvironment.java
javac StartEnvironment.java
java StartEnvironment
pause
```
