# 2.8) Build Tools

The build tools briefly described on this section will be deeply explained according to my needs on real projects. So this page might not be a complete tutorial on each tool but a small description of its capabilities.

[Prettier](#h1)

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. 

[ESLint](#h2)

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. 

[npm scripts](#h3)

If you need to perform operations on your package before(after/during/etc) it is used, in a way that is not dependent on the operating system or architecture of the target system, use npm scripts. 

[Webpack](#h4)

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding plugins are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
