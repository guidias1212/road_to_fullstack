**Prettier:**

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.

**ESLint:**

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. 

<a name="h3"/>

**npm scripts:**

If you need to perform operations on your package before(after/during/etc) it is used, in a way that is not dependent on the operating system or architecture of the target system, use npm scripts.

**Webpack:**

Webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding plugins are included. Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
