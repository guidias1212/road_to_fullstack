# 1.12.1) Scrum

Scrum is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed stand-up meetings, called daily scrums.

**Framework:**

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. Scrum is not a process or a technique for building products; rather, it is a framework within which you can employ various processes and techniques. Scrum makes clear the relative efficacy of your product management and development practices so that you can improve.

The Scrum framework consists of Scrum Teams and their associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to Scrum’s success and usage.

In Scrum, the prescribed events are used to create regularity. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration.

**Sprint:**

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of two weeks or one month during which a potentially releasable product increment is created. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. Sprints consist of the Sprint planning, daily scrums, the development work, the Sprint review, and the Sprint retrospective.

* In Sprint planning, the work to be performed in the Sprint is planned collaboratively by the Scrum Team.

* The Daily Scrum Meeting is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Scrum Team to synchronize the activities and create a plan for that day.

* A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and make changes to the Product Backlog, if needed.

* The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. In this meeting, the Scrum Team is to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the subsequent Sprint.

<a name="h2"/>

**Roles:**

The Scrum Team consists of three roles, namely a ScrumMaster, a Product Owner, and the Team.

**ScrumMaster:**

The ScrumMaster is the keeper of the scrum process. He/she is responsible for:

* Making the process run smoothly.

* Removing obstacles that impact productivity.

* Organizing and facilitating the critical meetings.

**Product Owner:**

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Team.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:

* Expressing Product Backlog items clearly.

* Ordering the Product Backlog items to best achieve goals and missions.

* Optimizing the value of the work the Team performs.

* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Team will work on further.

* Ensuring that the Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one is allowed to tell the Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Team is not allowed to act on what anyone else says. This is ensured by ScrumMaster.

**The Team:**

The Team is self-organizing and cross-functional. That means the team comprises of analysts, designers, developers, testers, etc. as appropriate and as relevant to the project.

Optimal Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. The Team size should be kept in the range from five to nine people, if possible. Fewer than five team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination.

The scrum team delivers product iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental deliveries of a complete product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

<a name="h3"/>

**ScrumMaster:**

The ScrumMaster serves the **Product Owner** in several ways, including:

* Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management.

* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items.

* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment.

* Ensuring that the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value.

* Understanding and practicing agility.

* Facilitating Scrum events as needed.

The ScrumMaster serves the **Scrum Team** in several ways, including:

* Coaching the Scrum Team in self-organization and cross-functionality.

* Helping the Scrum Team to create high-value products.

* Removing impediments to the Scrum Team’s progress.

* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

* Coaching the Scrum Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

The ScrumMaster serves the **Organization** in several ways, including:

* Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption.

* Planning Scrum implementations within the organization.

* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development.

* Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team.

* Working with other ScrumMasters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

<a name="h4"/>

**Events:**

Scrum Process Framework can be viewed by means of a sequence of events and the corresponding artifacts. The Scrum events are time-boxed events. That means, in a project, every scrum event has a predefined maximum duration. These events enable transparency on the project progress to all who are involved in the project. The vital events of scrum are:

* The Sprint

* Sprint Planning

* Daily Scrum Meetings

* The Sprint Review

* The Sprint Retrospective

**The Sprint:**

During a Sprint, a working product Increment is developed. It is usually of duration two weeks or one month, and this duration remains constant for all the sprints in the project. We cannot have varying durations for the different sprints in a project. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint. It provides guidance to the Team on how to build the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The scope of the sprint is clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and the Team accordingly to requirements learning. Thus, each Sprint has associated with it a definition of what has to be built, a design, a flexible plan for building it, the development work and the product increment.

A Sprint can be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the organization changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. A sprint can be cancelled only by product owner.

**Sprint Planning:**

The work to be performed during Sprint is planned in the Sprint Planning Meeting. Sprint Planning Meeting has a duration of a maximum of four hours for two week Sprints and eight hours for one month Sprints. It is the responsibility of the Scrum Master to ensure that the meeting takes place and that all the required attendees are present and understand the purpose of the scheduled meeting. The Scrum Master moderates the meeting to monitor the sustenance of discussion and closure on time.

Sprint Planning focuses on the following two questions:

* What needs/can be delivered in the Sprint Increment?

* How will the work needed for the execution of Sprint be achieved?

The inputs to this meeting are:

* The Product Backlog.

* The latest product Increment.

* Projected capacity of the Team during the Sprint.

* Past performance of the Team.

The Scrum Team discusses the functionality that can be developed during the Sprint. Product Owner provides clarifications on the Product Backlog items. The team selects the items from the Product Backlog for the Sprint.

The Scrum Team then sets up a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that provides guidance to the Team on building the Product Increment. The Team decides how they will build the selected functionality into a working product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint and the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

The work during a sprint is estimated during Sprint Planning and may be of varying size and/or effort. By the end of the Sprint Planning meeting, the work is divided into tasks of duration of one day or less. This happens to enable work allocation and track the completion. If the Team realizes that it has too much or too little work, they can renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner.

The Team may also invite others (not part of Scrum Team) to attend the Sprint Planning meeting to obtain technical or domain advice or help in estimation.

**Daily Scrum Meetings:**

The Daily Scrum Meeting is held at the same time and same place every day to reduce complexity.

During the meeting, each Team member explains:

* What did he do yesterday that helped the Team meet the Sprint Goal?

* What will he do today to help the Team meet the Sprint Goal?

* Does he see any impediments that prevent him or the Team from achieving the Sprint Goal?

**Sprint Review:**

A Sprint Review is held at the end of every Sprint. During the Sprint Review, a presentation of the increment is discussed. In this meeting, the Scrum Team and the stakeholders collaborate to understand what was done in the Sprint. Based on that, and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, the attendees arrive at the next steps required that could increase value. The objective of Sprint Review is to obtain feedback and progress together with all the stakeholders.

The Sprint Review is normally held for two hours for two week sprints and for four hours for one month sprints.

The Sprint Review includes the following aspects:

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders, invited by the Product Owner.

* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been completed during the sprint and what has not been completed.

* The Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems they ran into, and how those problems were solved.

* The Team demonstrates the work that they have completed and answer questions about the Increment.

* The entire group then discusses on what to do next. The Sprint Review provides valuable input to Sprint Planning of the subsequent Sprint.

* The Scrum Team then reviews the timeline, budget, potential capabilities, and marketplace for the next anticipated release of the product increment.

* The outcome of the Sprint Review is an updated Product Backlog, which defines the Product Backlog items for the next Sprint.

**Sprint Retrospective:**

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is usually a one hour meeting for two-week duration sprints and a three hour meeting for one month duration Sprints.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

* Combine the learnings from the last Sprint, with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.

* Identify the major items that went well and potential improvements.

* Creation of a plan for implementing improvements to increase product quality.

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to introspect and improve within the Scrum process framework so as to make the next Sprint outcome more effective.

**Artifacts:**

Scrum Artifacts provide key information that the Scrum Team and the stakeholders need to be aware of for understanding the product under development, the activities done, and the activities being planned in the project. The following artifacts are defined in Scrum Process Framework:

* Product Backlog

* Sprint Backlog

* Increment

* Burn-Down Chart

These are the minimum required artifacts in a scrum project but might be more, depending on the project.

**Product Backlog:**

The Product Backlog is an ordered list of features that are needed as part of the final product and it is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made.

The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. Product Backlog items have: description, order, estimate and value. These items are normally described as User Stories. The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability and order.

The Product Backlog constantly changes to incorporate what is required to make it effective. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists.

As the product being built is used and gains value, the Product Backlog becomes a larger and more exhaustive list. Changes in business requirements, market conditions, or technology, cause changes in the Product Backlog, making it a live artifact.

Product Backlog refinement means adding detail, estimates, and priority order to the Product Backlog items. This is an ongoing process performed by the Product Owner and the Team. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement needs to be done.

Higher-ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower-ordered ones. More precise estimates are made based on the greater clarity and increased detail. The lower the order, the lesser is the detail.

**Sprint Backlog:**

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint and a plan for delivering the product Increment, realizing the Sprint Goal.

The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Team about what functionality will be made available in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality as a working product Increment.

The Sprint Backlog is a plan with enough detail that can be understood during the Daily Scrum. The Team modifies the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint. The Sprint Backlog changes during the Sprint. This change occurs as the Team works through the plan and learns more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal.

As new work is required, the Team adds it to the Sprint Backlog. As work is performed or completed, the estimated remaining work is updated. When elements of the plan are deemed unnecessary, they are removed. Only the Team can change its Sprint Backlog during a Sprint. The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Team.

**Increment:**

The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint combined with the increments of all previous Sprints. At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be a working product, which means it must be in a useable condition. It must be in working condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to actually release it.

The Scrum Team must agree on what is considered to be an Increment. This varies significantly per Scrum Team, but, team members must have a shared understanding of which work needs to be completed.

The same understanding guides the Team in knowing how many Product Backlog items they can select during a Sprint Planning. The purpose of each Sprint is to deliver Increments of potentially releasable functionality.

Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality on every Sprint. This Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to release it immediately. If the understanding of an increment is part of the conventions, standards, or guidelines of the development organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not a convention of the development organization, the Scrum Team must define a definition of Increment appropriate for the product.

Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.

**Sprint Burn-Down Chart:**

At any point during a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint Backlog can be summed. The Team tracks the remaining work on every Daily Scrum to check the likelihood of achieving the Sprint Goal. By tracking the remaining work during the Sprint, the Team can manage its progress.

Sprint Burn-Down Chart is a practice for checking the work done by the Scrum Team. This has been proven to be an useful technique in monitoring the Sprint progress towards the Sprint Goal.

The Product Owner tracks the total remaining work on, at least, every Sprint Review. The Product Owner compares the work done with the remaining work to check progress toward completing the goal in time. This information is shared with all stakeholders.

**User Stories:**

In software development, the product features play a crucial role. The features define the final product. They are known as Requirements in the general terminology. The software development project success lies in understanding the user requirements accurately and appropriately, and then implementing them in the final product. Requirements or product features need to be well known to the project development team.

In 1999, Kent Beck came up with the term User Stories for product features. He described that an User Story is narrated from user perspective regarding what he or she wants to have rather than what the system can do for him. The view changed from product to user. User Stories became a standard Requirement in all Agile frameworks.

In Scrum projects, the Product Backlog is a list of user stories. These User Stories are prioritized and taken into the Sprint Backlog in the Sprint Planning Meeting.

Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog and for the User Stories. However, it does not mean that only the product owner writes user stories. Anyone in the Scrum Team can write user stories, and the activity can be spread across the project as the requirements get refined and new functionalities get added.

The User Story **structure** is like:

As a -Type of User-,

I want -To Perform Some Task-,

So that -I can achieve some goal/benefit/value-.

**User Story: Customer’s Cash Withdrawal example:**

As a Customer,

I want to withdraw cash from an ATM,

So that I don't have to wait in line at the Bank.

**User Story Acceptance Criteria:**

Each User Story also has Acceptance Criterion defined, so that correctness of implementation of the user story is confirmed by passing the Acceptance Test that is based on the Acceptance Criterion.

Following are the sample acceptance criterion for the example of User Story Customer’s Withdrawal of Cash:

**Acceptance Criterion 1:**

**Given** that the account is creditworthy

* And the card is valid
* And the dispenser contains cash,

**When** the customer requests the cash

**Then** ensure the account is debited

* And ensure cash is dispensed
* And ensure the card is returned.

**Acceptance Criterion 2:**

**Given** that the account is overdrawn

* And the card is valid

**When** the customer requests the cash

**Then** ensure the rejection message is displayed

* And ensure cash is not dispensed
* And ensure the card is returned.

**Burn-Down Charts:**

The sprint tracking is usually done using Burn-Down Chart. Burn-Down Chart shows the remaining effort in day-wise number of hours. For example, let's consider a 2-week sprint:

**Sprint Duration:** 2 Weeks

**No. of Days per Week:** 5

**No. of Hrs. per Day:** 6

**No. of Resources:** 6

Total remaining effort at the beginning of sprint is 2*5*6*6 = 360 hrs.

In an ideal scenario, 36 hours of work gets reduced in the remaining work and the burn-down chart looks as:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guidias1212/road_to_fullstack/master/images/scrum_bum_down_chart1.png)

If the sprint work gets delayed and time commitment is not met, the burn-down chart looks as:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guidias1212/road_to_fullstack/master/images/scrum_bum_down_chart2.png)

But, as the burn-down chart is drawn daily, and the slippage is known early, corrective actions can be taken to meet the sprint time line. Let's suppose, the team stretches to meet the timeline, the burn-down chart looks as:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guidias1212/road_to_fullstack/master/images/scrum_bum_down_chart3.png)

This way, at any point in time in a Sprint, the total work remaining in the Sprint can be visualized and the possibility of achieving the goal in time can be improved.

**Estimation:**

In Scrum Projects, Estimation is done by the entire team during Sprint Planning Meeting. The objective of the Estimation is to consider the User Stories for the Sprint by Priority and by the Ability of the team to deliver during the Time Box of the Sprint.

Product Owner ensures that the prioritized User Stories are clear, can be subjected to estimation and brought to the beginning of the Product Backlog.

As the Scrum Team is responsible for delivering the product increment, they must take care to select User Stories for the Sprint based on the size of the Product Increment and the effort required for the same.

The size of the Product Increment is estimated in terms of User Story Points. Once the size is determined, the effort is estimated.

The Scrum Estimation of User Stories is the degree of difficulty for each User Story. To set the degree of difficulty, a particular scale is used.

There are several types of scales that are used in Scrum Estimation:

* Numeric Sizing (1 through 10)

* T-shirt Sizes (XS, S, M, L, XL XXL, XXXL)

* Fibonacci Sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc.)

* Dog Breeds (Chihuahua,………,Great Dane)

<a name="h9"/>

**Tools:**

Scrum Tools facilitate planning and tracking for Scrum projects. They provide a single place for managing the product backlog, sprint backlog, planning and tracking Sprints, displaying Burndown charts, conducting daily Scrum Meetings, and conducting Scrum Retrospectives.

There are many different types of Scrum Tools available. Some are free (open source), some are paid, and for some, you get a distilled version of the tool. However, to get all the features and scalability, you need to buy a full version.
