# 1.12) Agile Methodologies

Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

**Concepts:**

Agile methodologies argue that, above all, we should seek client satisfaction through continuous deliveries of value-adding software, by keeping up constant communication with the client and, also, by focusing on communication between team members. Contrary to previous practices, the Agile methodology is not characterised by the complete definition of a product – a complete analysis or the definition of all categories/requirements – but by a dynamic interaction that allows constant delivery.

**Agile software development principles:**

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:

* 1) Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

* 2) Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.

* 3) Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).

* 4) Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.

* 5) Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.

* 6) Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).

* 7) Working software is the primary measure of progress.

* 8) Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.

* 9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.

* 10) Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.

* 11) Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

* 12) Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.
