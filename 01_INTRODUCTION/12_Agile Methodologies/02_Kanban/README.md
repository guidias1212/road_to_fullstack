# 1.12.2) Kanban

Kanban is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity, and by improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

Work items are visualized to give participants a view of progress and process, from start to finishâ€”usually via a Kanban board. Work is pulled as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when requested.
