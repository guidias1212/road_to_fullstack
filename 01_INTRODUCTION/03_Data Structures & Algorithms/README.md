# 1.3) Data Structures & Algorithms

**Data Structures**

Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.

Important categories of algorithms from the data structure point of view:

-**Search:** Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

-**Sort:** Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

-**Insert:** Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

-**Update:** Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

-**Delete:** Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.
